### CPSC 120

* Lab 06

    Lab 6 was one my favorite lab assignments in CPSC-120A. Part 1 explored how you use if-else statements and command lines run a version of the Mad Lib game, while part 2 explored how to use if-else staments and the OR/AND operators to run the BlackJack game. In part 1, primarily, I learned how argument indexing works. For example, command-line 0 belonged to the program name and command-line 1 belonged to the protein for the program. In part 2, I learned to the use the OR "||" operator. I was able to identify the difference between the usage of the OR and AND operator, where each statement has to be true for an AND operator, whereas at least one statement has to be true when using the OR operator for an if-else statement.

* Lab 07

    Lab 7 was another of my favorite lab assignments for CPSC-120A. I liked how this lab assignment had the class constructing a code to determine whether an individual can park their car on a specific street and at a specific time. Similar to Lab 6, Lab 7 also explored how to apply OR and AND operators. However, the difference between the two was that Lab 7 challenged students to apply both operators. I learned that paranthesis were really useful throughout the lab when using both operators in an if statement because without them, you wouldn't get the expected outcome and encounter a logical error.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was my third favorite lab assignment for CPSC-120A. I enojyed how the lab explored the concept of using 2-D vectors and for-loops. Out of the two parts in Lab 10, part 2 was by far my favorite section of it. Throughout part 2, I learned how to initialize a 2-D vector, which is writing two vectors in one line of code: "std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>". Also, I learned how the code loops through all the states, while simultaneously calculating each element's density.
